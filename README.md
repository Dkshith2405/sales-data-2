# Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database (Python + SQL)

This repository shows **every step** from creating a database to connecting with Python and running **SQL-based summaries** with a simple chart — exactly as required in Task 7. The database is SQLite, so **no server setup** is needed. You may use a **tiny subset** of the **Online Retail II** dataset to populate the table, or let the script create a small sample for you.

--

## ✅ What You’ll Build
- A SQLite file: `sales_data.db` containing one table `sales`
- A Python script that **creates** and **loads data** into the DB plus **runs SQL** and **plots a bar chart**

--

## Step performed

1) **Create the SQLite database and load data**
2) **Run SQL inside Python to get summaries and a chart**

## Files Included
- `sales_data.ipynb` – codes for creating database, insertion and analysis
